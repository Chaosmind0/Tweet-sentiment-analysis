# Tweet-sentiment-analysis
This project is used to analyze the public opinion on Twitter.

Due to the large size of the dataset used for training, it has not been uploaded to GIT. Please go to the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140 by yourself, download the file and extract it to the "data/" folder. Furthermore, if you open the dataset by VS Code, then VS Code will alert you of some issues within the dataset. You can use VS Code to automatically fix these problems.
